### I have tried the following:

- [ ] Disabling QuickConnect
- [ ] Disabling OpenVPN
- [ ] Restoring web port to default (5000/5001)
- [ ] Restarting NAS
- [ ] Reinstall ZT
- [ ] Checked for presence of `dev/net/tun`
- [ ] Verified that ZT is or is not running with `ps aux | grep zerotier`
- [ ] confirmed that config files exist in `/var/packages/zerotier/target/var`
- [ ] Issued `zerotier-cli` commands as root

### I am aware of the following

- [ ] The GUI is deprecated and may not work on my particular NAS
- [ ] The CLI is the recommended interface for controlling ZT

### Other important information
